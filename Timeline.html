		<h1>Timeline</h1>
		<h3>October 26, 2018</h3>
		<p>YNW Sakchaser, aka Anthony Williams, 21, and YNW Juvy, aka Christopher Thomas Jr., 19, are shot and killed. The two were last spotted by Miramar police at 3:20 a.m. Eastern time, close to Fort Lauderdale, and they arrived at Memorial Hospital Miramar at 4:35 a.m. with multiple gunshot wounds. A police spokesperson stated that "they were dead already." Melly posted on social media about his loss. He said, "They took my brothers from me over jealousy." Melly claimed that the killers "want to see him break down and stop, or in jail, or in a box."</p>
		
		<h3>January 3, 2019</h3>
		<p>Melly is being held in Lee County once more in relation to the allegations made against him in June 2018. He is seen smiling in his mugshot. Pitchfork was able to get court records showing that Melly entered a not guilty plea to felony counts of possession of paraphernalia and less than 20 grams of marijuana. After being found guilty, he is given a jail sentence with credit for time served.</p>

		<h3>February 13, 2019</h3>
		<p>Melly is arrested on murder charges. Police allege that he shot and killed Williams and Thomas while Cortlen Henry, aka YNW Bortlen, tried to stage the deaths as a drive-by shooting. Under Florida law, Melly could face life imprisonment or the death penalty. He maintains his innocence on Instagram: “Unfortunately, a lot of rumors and lies are being said but no worries god is with me.” (The post is eventually deleted.)</p>
		
		<h3>February 25, 2019</h3>
		<p>In public court documents, investigators reveal more details about the charges against Melly. Police officers cite phone records which allegedly confirm that Melly was at the scene of the crime. They also reference autopsy reports and crime scene details, which allegedly confirm that Melly shot YNW Sakchaser and YNW Juvy from inside the car. Police argue that the “drive-by” bullet holes on the outside of the car were “staged in an effort to misdirect law enforcement investigation.”</p>
		
		<h3>April 18, 2019</h3>
		<p>Florida prosecutors file paperwork signaling their intent to seek the death penalty against YNW Melly.</p>
		
		<h3>November 22, 2019</h3>
		<p>Melly releases a new album, Melly vs. Melvin, which eventually goes gold. It spent 31 weeks on the Billboard 200 albums chart, beginning with its debut at No. 8 on December 7, 2019.</p>
		
		<h3>May 23, 2020</h3>
		<p>YNW Bortlen, who was arrested in 2019 for the double murder with Melly, is placed under home arrest.</p>
		
		<h3>October 23, 2020</h3>
		<p>Melly and Bortlen face wrongful death claims from the families of the rappers Anthony "YNW Sakchaser" Williams and Christopher "YNW Juvy" Thomas Jr., whom they were arrested for killing. The shooting occurred as a result of "tension" between the friends over "the prospect of large amounts of money coming in" and "how that money should be distributed," according to the lawsuit submitted on behalf of YNW Sakchaser's family. "The people on the receiving end will get more when there are fewer people splitting up the prospective money," wrote Sakchaser's estate attorneys.</p>
		
		<h3>August 13, 2021</h3>
		<p>With appearances from Future, Kodak Black, Tee Grizzley, Young Thug, Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Baby, Lil Durk, and more, Melly releases another album titled Just a Matter of Slime. On August 28, 2021, it makes its debut on the Billboard 200 at No. 11, where it stays for three weeks.</p>
		
		<h3>July 6, 2022</h3>
		<p>YNW Melly is no longer facing the death penalty.</p>

		<h3>November 10, 2022</h3>
		<p>An appeals court in Broward County opens the door for prosecutors to retry YNW Melly for the death sentence. The rapper had been indicted again, but the court determined that prosecutors did not have to frequently tell the public that they are pursuing the death sentence.</p>

		<h3>April 19, 2023</h3>
		<p>Jury selection begins</p>

		<h3>June 12, 2023</h3>
		<p>Trial begins with opening arguments.</p>

		<h3>June 16, 2023</h3>
		<p>YNW Melly's trial's first week has come to an end. Felicia Holmes, a trained nurse whose daughter, Mariah Hamilton, is said to have been dating YNW Melly when his two companions died in 2018, gave several hours of evidence on the last day of the first week.</p>

		<h3>June 20, 2023</h3>
		<p>The defense, which objected to the state's questioning of Felicia Holmes the week before and said the prosecution had used improper evidence, filed a motion for a mistrial, which the court denied. Despite her initial judgment of the state's prosecution, the judge decided to allow the trial to proceed.</p>
		
		<h3>June 28, 2023</h3>
		<p>On Day 10, the prosecution uses testimony from a detective sergeant to support its claim that the victims were shot dead inside the car and could not have been murdered in a drive-by shooting. Anthony "YNW Sakchaser" Williams was shot many times, according to the medical examiner, after suffering a bullet wound to the back of his head that proved fatal.</p>

		<h3>July 17, 2023</h3>
		<p>Continuing its case against YNW Melly, the prosecution rests it more than a month after the trial started. Witnesses from the state examined and discussed video from the evening of Christopher “YNW Juvy” Thomas Jr. and Anthony “YNW Sakchaser” Williams' deaths. To prove that the cell phone that was allegedly found at the crime site belonged to Melly, prosecutors also had witnesses read through a large list of texts that Melly allegedly sent. 
		Witnesses included members of Melly's personal circle, including Treveon Glass, a YNW member and friend who was at a recording studio with the group in the hours before Sakchaser and Juvy's deaths, and Felicia Holmes, a registered nurse whose daughter, Mariah Hamilton, is said to have been dating YNW Melly when his two friends were killed. 
		The main detective on the case, Mark Moretti, and firearms expert Jorge Bello of the Broward Sheriff's Office were also questioned by the state. As the state's top witness, Moretti testified for more than a week, and Melly's defense team tried to discredit his credibility. For instance, the defense questioned Moretti's authority to address matters such as the location of mobile phone data. During the cross-examination, the defense also claimed that the detectives ignored other possible candidates in favor of focusing on Melly as the main murder suspect. The  defense made many motions for a mistrial, but Judge Murphy turned them down.</p>
		
		<h3>July 18, 2023</h3>
		<p>Adrian Green, a friend of YNW Melly, is the only person who is called by the defense. Melly told the judge he was choosing not to testify in the case while the jury was not in the room.</p>

		<h3>July 20, 2023</h3>
		<p>Finally, the prosecution presents its case. Through reconstructed photos, it seeks for proof that YNW Cortlen was not capable of firing the shots that killed YNW Sakchaser and YNW Juvy. Also, phone tracking data apparently proving YNW Melly's whereabouts is shown; however, the defense has maintained that the phone was used in a shared manner. Before the jury starts deliberating, the defense also presents its closing arguments.</p>

		<h3>July 22, 2023</h3>
		<p>After three days of deadlock during the jury's deliberations, Judge John J. Murphy III announces a mistrial. </p>
	
		<h3>July 25, 2023</h3>
		<p>Prosecutors stated that they intend for a retrial.</p>
