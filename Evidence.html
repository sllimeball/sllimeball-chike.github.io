		<h1>Evidence</h1>
	<p> Several pieces of evidence against Melly have been discovered in this trial. Many pieces of evidence were considered irrelevant and could not be presented to the jury. The defense team attempted to have a mistrial by prejudice, but it was rejected . Text messages was shown despite the fact that other persons shared and used Melly's phone, DNA evidence, as well as an undercover police gang that later unmasked to show Danny Polo were all presented in this trial. Danny Polo stated that he believed melly was a member of a gang, which may have motive. A medical examiner's was presented,  a glass expert, a ballistics expert, Melly's former friend, lead investigator Mark Moretti, a documentary, text messages showing Melly acting rudely toward his mother, including calling her a b**ch, and an apparent confession. One witness, who was called by the defense, said that Melly was with him during the killings and that she cried when he learned of it.</p><br>
	
		<h2>All pieces of evidence found against Jamell Demons</h2>
		
		<DL>
		<dt><strong>Video Studio Evidence:</strong></dt>
		<dd> The prosecutors provided video footage of YNW Melly entering the left backseat of a gray vehicle in which the victims were murdered and the side in which the shots allegedly came from. Previously, by YNW Melly co-defendant, YNW Bortlen(Cortlen Henry), it was stated that Melly never entered that vehicle. Eventually, the story changed to YNW Melly eventually getting out the vehicle to go into another before the victims were murdered. This video proves the case that Melly did get into the last backseat of the car.<br>

		<dt><strong>Hospital Surveillance</strong></dt>
		<dd>The prosecutors provided video evidence of YNW Bortlen(Melly's co defendant) arriving at the hospital. Apparently, Melly was not at the scene. When Bortlen arrived at the hospital, he had a hoodie on which was not being worn at the time of the murders, and gunshot residue was found on him. Melly's location was unknown.

		<dt><strong>Glass Expert</strong></dt>
		<dd> A glass expert was brought as a witness in this case. He testified about the location of glass being foud, the examined pieces of glass with an outcome of being unable to tell if the driveby was staged or not.</dd>
		
		<dt><strong>Firearms Expert</strong></dt>
		<dd>The Firearms expert, Jorge Bello, stated that a .40 caliber gun was involved but the exact gun used was unidentifiable and that more than one gun was possible. </dd>
		
		<dt><strong>Medical Examiner</strong><dt>
		<dd>The Medical Examiners , Rebecca MacDougall and Dr. Adrienne Sauder, performed the autopsy of the bodies. They established that the timeframe of the wounds was unable to be determined and a fatal left to right shot was found on one of the YNW Sakchaser. Another left to right shot was found on YNW Juvy however, at the time of this shot, the heart was not beating. Both victims were shot multiple times after they had died. This testimony contradicts the statement giving by YNW Bortlen of the driverby happening on the right side of the vehicle.</dd>
		
		<dt><strong>Gang Expert</strong></dt>
		<dd>The undercover then uncovered gang expert, Danny Polo, testified that Melly was involved in a gang. All the music melly posted, the people he was around the signs he threw up is what caused the expert to believe this and think that the gang had something to do with the motive of melly killing his 2 friends.</dd>
		
		<dt><strong>Ballitics</strong></dt>
		<dd>Ballistics expert claimed the bullets came from where YNW Melly was sitting and that there was no driveby. He also claimed only one persom shot them. They came on here to prove medical examiner point and to show how YNW Bortlen could not have been the shooter. The bullets were shot from inside the vehicle and that no driveby ever occured.</dd>
		
		<dt><strong>Gunshot Residue</strong></dt>
		<dd>Gunshot Residude was not found on YNW Melly but on YNW Bortlen instead.</dd>
		
		<dt><strong>Cellphone Records</strong></dt>
		<dd>A lot of evidence provided was from the cellphone. In this cellphone which the prosecutors claimed to be Melly's phone, they showed over 500 photos and videos of YNW melly,  text messages from Melly to multiple people, one in which he states Shh, I did that", cell tower pings and calls.</dd>
		
		<dt><strong>Physical Evidence</strong></dt>
		<dd>Melly's DNA was not found in the car until July 2023 on the door handle. There was no gun found or determined. No Eye Witnesses. There was however, one bullet casing found in the car but it did not lead to anything. There was also no actual motive in this case but only suspected motives.</dd>
